# Munchr

Munchr is a food app where users are able to take pictures of their food, and Munchr will analyze it and tell them its nutrition, calories, and give alternative healthier suggestions. Munchr will use Gemini AI to analyze the nutrition, and OPENPRICENGINE to find ingredients or food alternatives to make their meal healthier.
